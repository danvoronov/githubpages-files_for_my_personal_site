This was <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">the first serious</strong> fiction book (series) I read. Before it, of course, I’d read many fairy tales, children’s books, and kids’ detective stories which were super popular in the 90s, but this was something else entirely.</p><p name="47cb" id="47cb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I hadn’t heard of <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Harry Potter </strong>back then (the texts started coming out in 1997–98). For some reason, I remained oblivious to these books for a very long time and only paid attention when the movie came out — but I still didn’t read them, although it later became clear that for the next generation, it was a life-shaping series. Meanwhile, my classmates were reading <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Tolkien</strong>. For some reason, I wasn’t interested in that at all back then either. They even dressed up and hit each other with swords. I only read Tolkien when the movies came out. These huge and very popular series passed me by as a teenager, but “The Chronicles of Amber” found its way to me by chance. Maybe if it had been “The Lord of the Rings” or “Harry Potter” or “Haunting Adeline,” I would have grown up to be a different person =)</p><p name="c6b0" id="c6b0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My first foray into speculative fiction (though it’s a blend of fantasy, noir, mythology, and science fiction) was the world of The Chronicles of Amber. I loved the <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">characters </strong>and their attire, the colors, the princes/princesses traveling between worlds (Shadows). Their complex relationships, friendships and feuds, intrigues, and multi-layered plots — it was all incredibly dynamic and captivating.</p><p name="7e7f" id="7e7f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I don’t even remember the full extent of my impressions, but the book definitely became a <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">turning point</strong> for me and my love for reading.</p><p name="835c" id="835c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the first pentalogy, the main character, Corwin, starts with amnesia, and I gradually learn his past along with him — sure, it’s a bit of a trope, but I remind you, this was the first <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">such</em> book I read. There’s the primal world of Order (Amber) and <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">passages between worlds </strong>— I really liked the concept of the Pattern (the Labyrinth) that one must walk to travel, and that 🛑 <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">you can’t go back</strong>.

After my math degree, I pursued a second degree in psychology from 2008–2011, where I became particularly interested in unlocking creative and personal potential in people. Around the same time, coaching started to arrive in Kyiv, and I actively studied and practiced it too, I was part of the scene. I enjoyed working with individuals and groups, but I always wanted more, some kind of <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">framework for changing communities</strong>, companies, countries.</p><p name="edae" id="edae" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That’s how I got interested in the books by brothers Chip and Dan Heath, especially “The Power of Moments,” which I read a bit later. Their books are very practical. And I read “Switch” earlier; it’s packed with usefulness about organizing change in people.</p><p name="0f03" id="0f03" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">They draw on research from <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">psychology, sociology, economics</strong>, and other behavioral sciences. They don’t just voice opinions; they show <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">why </em>certain approaches work, backing it up with data. The book demystifies the change process and offers an alternative to the common belief that change requires budgets, immense willpower, or deep problem analysis.</p><figure name="aec4" id="aec4" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*eXBUmC8O8tpunEixdyb3oQ.png" data-width="805" data-height="655" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*eXBUmC8O8tpunEixdyb3oQ.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">framework</figcaption></figure><p name="75bd" id="75bd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">They simplified the change<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"> template to the Rider and the Elephant</strong> (similar to Kahneman’s fast and slow thinking), making it the central metaphor of the book. The Rider’s job is to point in a clear direction, break down big goals into small ones, and find bright spots (examples of success). The Elephant’s job is to shrink the change (so it’s not daunting) and create a sense of identity (people do what aligns with their self-image). And then, overall, to Shape the Path: change the environment to make desired behaviors easier and undesired ones harder; build habits; rally the herd.</p><p name="99d4" id="99d4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Then they break down<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"> specific case</strong> studies of how people intervened in large systems (direct the rider, motivate the elephant, shape the path of change) where others live and work, and changed them for the better. Sometimes I had this “wow” feeling that it’s possible, and I want to do that too. Change systems.</p><p name="4468" id="4468" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This book is important to me because, from my experience, individual change-coaching-therapy for the better often works short-term like “swimming against the current,” and people will endlessly revert if the <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">surrounding systems are unhealthy</strong> and hinder rather than help them live, rejoice, connect, play, create, etc. The main solution is to change not only people but also the environment and cultures.</p><p name="4067" id="4067" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For this, I attended various urban workshops, learned how Berlin excels at transforming third places, and we did interventions in Kyiv, though I can’t say they were wildly successful. I’d love to “fix systems” at the level of large organizations, but for now, both reading about it and what’s accessible to me still feels like science fiction. But it was <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">very encouraging</strong> that they succeeded, and each case study fills me with optimism.</p><blockquote name="6ef2" id="6ef2" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">📚 There’s also a lot about the need for systemic change in “Stolen Focus” — you can’t solve the problem of large companies turning the internet into a machine that degrades mental health and attention by meditating; so we need to get together and, for example, establish public ownership or impose regulatory policies on them.</blockquote><p name="f269" id="f269" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote graf--trailing">📚 Similar books I’ve read at the habit level include “Atomic Habits” by an American PE teacher who decided to create a program for changing habits. I rated it higher because it’s one of the clearest, most practical books I’ve read, and I’m not detailing it here only because it was published in such huge print runs that everyone should have two copies by now. At the company level, there’s “Reinventing Organizations” about organizations with peer-to-peer management principles. Goldratt’s “The Goal” about the weakest link also fits here.</p></div></div></section><section name="415e" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="3fdc" id="3fdc" class="graf graf--h3 graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf--leading"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h3-strong">“The Book of est,” 1976</strong></h3><div name="d0b3" id="d0b3" class="graf graf--mixtapeEmbed graf-after--h3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Book_of_est" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Book_of_est" class="markup--anchor markup--mixtapeEmbed-anchor" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Book_of_est"><strong class="markup--strong markup--mixtapeEmbed-strong">The Book of est - Wikipedia</strong><br><em class="markup--em markup--mixtapeEmbed-em">The Book of est is a fictional account of the training created by Werner Erhard, ( est), or Erhard Seminars Training…</em>en.wikipedia.org</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Book_of_est" class="js-mixtapeImage mixtapeImage u-ignoreBlock" data-media-id="7bd05951e805b3151828419c2cb457b7" data-thumbnail-img-id="0*DMmtFQESoWN6bPN9" style="background-image: url(https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/160/160/0*DMmtFQESoWN6bPN9);"></a></div><p name="37f5" id="37f5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--mixtapeEmbed">📅 Reading years: Since 2007 / 23 years old.

The program teaches to distinguish experience from our interpretation of it. It’s constantly said that the training is an EXPERIENCE; its logical constructs are needed to provoke them. If you want, you can find tons of contradictions in everything the trainer says.

Honestly, <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">I don’t know why this book is at the top of my rating</strong>. There doesn’t seem to be anything particularly special about it. Nate discusses several different subject areas (meteorology, finance, politics, sports, seismology, etc.) where we try to predict the future and constantly fail at it.</p><p name="8d01" id="8d01" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He also adds cognitive psychology, showing that people are very, very, very, <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">very bad at intuitively assessing probability</strong> (which is what betting thrives on). How easily news manipulates our constructed understanding of reality. That most experts (especially in media, politics, economics), having studied for so long, have long “died” in their expertise and are thinking with concepts the world has long since moved on from, and their forecasts are worthless.</p><figure name="748d" id="748d" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*TWbsb6tatk1TbmJHFy2V8w.png" data-width="804" data-height="293" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*TWbsb6tatk1TbmJHFy2V8w.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">conditional probability</figcaption></figure><p name="fd57" id="fd57" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">It’s a popular science book about (Bayesian) probability. More popular and worldview-shaping than scientific or a textbook. What I liked about it was the wide variety of topics raised where understanding probability theory can help identify patterns.

A cool idea that we need the accuracy of describing the world specifically for a particular situation. Most people don’t even think that what they know is (in)correct with a certain probability. Moreover, it’s variable by context / over time — and they refer to scientists as authoritative gods who have “uncovered truths.” A lot of (bad) science has emerged from carelessly interpreted data collection results and faith in authorities, and (bad) journalism has further simplified, distorted, and spread it through the media.</p><blockquote name="6f0c" id="6f0c" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">He also describes overfitting well, which I had learned about before this from a course on data science.

They find that small “signal” part in information that matters. They are a little more accurate than others about what will happen soon.
